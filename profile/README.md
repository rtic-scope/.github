# RTIC Scope

RTIC Scope is an non-intrusive auxillary toolset for tracing [RTIC](https://rtic.rs) programs executing on ARMv7-M targets by exploiting the *Instrumentation Trace Macrocell* (ITM) and *Data Watchpoint and Trace* (DWT) units.
The target-generated ITM trace packet stream (henceforth referred to as the "trace stream") is recorded on a host system by reading from the *Embedded Trace Buffer* (ETB) via [probe-rs](https://probe.rs) or a serial device connected to the target's *Trace Port Interface Unit* (TPIU).

Recorded trace streams can be analyzed in real-time or replayed offline for post-mortem purposes.

## Toolset components

RTIC Scope is a collection of three crates:
- [`cargo-rtic-scope`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/tree/master/cargo-rtic-scope): the host-side daemon that records the trace stream, recovers RTIC app metadata, serializes the replay file to disk, and forwards the trace to a frontend;
- [`rtic-scope-api`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/tree/master/rtic-scope-api): the `serde` JSON API implemented by `cargo-rtic-scope` and any frontend; and
- [`cortex-m-rtic-trace`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/tree/master/cortex-m-rtic-trace): an auxilliary target-side crate that propely configures the ITM/DWT/TPIU units. [^1]

[^1]: This crate is a crutch and will be deprecated on v1.0.0 release: see https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/issues/90.

A [dummy frontend, `rtic-scope-frontend-dummy`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/frontend-dummy) [^2] is also available for reference purposes, but can be substituted by any frontend that implements the API: a graphical user interface, a database client, etc.

[^2]: The dummy only prints received trace information to `stderr` with absolute microsecond (and relative nanosecond) timestamps. These messages are echoed by `cargo-rtic-scope`.

The other repositories listed below (except [`itm`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/itm) [^3]) are dependencies with patches that are due (or already have been) pushed upstream.

[^3]: `itm` is a library for decoding the ITM packet protocol. Because of its general nature and detachment from the implemention of RTIC Scope, it is not a part of the project itself, but hosted here for convenience.

## Performance/resource impact of ITM/DWT tracing

[ARM's *Understanding Trace*, ยง7](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102119/0200/Can-trace-capture-affect-a-system-) states that:
> Except for the power that is consumed by the system trace components, trace is almost entirely non-invasive. This means that performing trace generation and collection does not influence the wider system.

The target-side code of RTIC Scope itself has a negligible performance impact during execution:
- the ITM/DWT/TPIU units need only be configured once in `#[init]` or during a later stage; and
- when software tasks are traced, a `u8` variable write must be done when entering and exiting the task.

Resource-wise, however, two DWT comparators currently need to be consumed in order to trace software tasks.

The performance of the host-side `cargo-rtic-scope` daemon has yet been measured.

## Limitations
As of v0.3.0, RTIC Scope supports RTIC v1.0.0.
Support for other real-time operating systems is not planned.

## Roadmap
See [the project milestones](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/milestones).

## Changelog
See [`cargo-rtic-scope/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Getting started
The purpose of RTIC Scope is to enable instant insight into your firmware if it is written in RTIC with ideally zero end-user overhead, except for setting some flags in the RTIC application declaration and potentially writing some configuration in a checked-in file. [^4]

[^4]: RTIC Scope is not quite there yet. See [#100](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/issues/100).

### Installing the toolset
Start by installing the toolset: [^5]
```shell
$ # Prepare by installing system libraries:
$ # if you have Nix available:
$ nix develop github:rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope?dir=contrib
$ # otherwise:
$ sudo apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi1-dev libudev-dev # or equivalent; see <https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs#building>
$ # then install RTIC Scope:
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope cargo-rtic-scope # install the cargo subcommand
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/rtic-scope/frontend-dummy # install the dummy frontend
```

[^5]: Installation cannot yet be done against the crate registery. See [#101](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope/issues/101).

### Reading the trace stream from the target
RTIC Scope implements two methods to extract the trace stream from the target.
The recommended method is via `probe-rs` which polls the /Embedded Trace Buffer/ (ETB) of the target by specifying `--chip` (e.g. `--chip stm32f401retx`, just like [`cargo-flash`](https://github.com/probe-rs/cargo-flash) [^cargo-flash]).
Using `probe-rs` also optionally flashes and resets your target with the chosen firmware (specify with `--bin`).
This can be disabled via `--dont-touch-target`.
The second method is by reading the trace stream from a serial device by specifying `--serial /path/to/serial/device`.
A raw ITM trace stream is expected on this device. This trace stream can be read from the SWO or TRACE debug pins. It's left to the end-user to configure hardware such that the expected stream can be read from the serial device.

[^cargo-flash] `cargo-rtic-scope` is an extension of `cargo-flash`. All options supported by `cargo-flash` are also supported by `cargo-rtic-scope`, e.g. `--bin` and `--list-chips`.

### Generating the trace stream on the target
When using the `probe-rs` approach the target is partially configured to emit ITM packets with timestamps when hardware tasks are entered and exited.
What remains is to flip any device-specific ITM master switches.
Work has begun on `probe-rs` to remove this burden from the end-user, but each platform is different.
No additional target-side configuration must be done unless software task tracing is wanted.
However, for reasons of symmetry, it is recommended that `cortex-m-rtic-trace` is employed.

Starting from a skeleton RTIC application for an `stm32f401retx` we have:
```rust
//! `rtic-scope-example`
#![no_main]
#![no_std]

use panic_semihosting as _;
use rtic;

#[rtic::app(device = stm32f4::stm32f401, dispatchers = [EXTI0, EXTI1])]
mod app {
    use cortex_m::peripheral::syst::SystClkSource;

    #[shared]
    struct Shared {}

    #[local]
    struct Local {}

    #[init]
    fn init(mut ctx: init::Context) -> (Shared, Local, init::Monotonics) {
        ctx.core.SYST.set_clock_source(SystClkSource::Core);
        ctx.core.SYST.set_reload(16_000_000); // period = 1s

        // Allow debugger to attach while sleeping (WFI)
        ctx.device.DBGMCU.cr.modify(|_, w| {
            w.dbg_sleep().set_bit();
            w.dbg_standby().set_bit();
            w.dbg_stop().set_bit()
        });

        sw_task::spawn().unwrap();

        (Shared {}, Local {}, init::Monotonics())
    }

    #[task(binds = SysTick)]
    fn hardware(_: hardware::Context) {
        software::spawn().unwrap();
    }

    #[task]
    fn software(_: software::Context) {}
}
```

We employ `cortex-m-rtic-trace` via:
```toml
# Cargo.toml additions
[package.metadata.rtic-scope]
# Required to recover metadata about device-specific exceptions
pac_name = "stm32f4"
pac_features = ["stm32f401"]
pac_version = "0.13"
interrupt_path = "stm32f4::stm32f401::Interrupt"

# required to read the ETB, and to calculate timestamps
tpiu_freq = 16000000
tpiu_baud = 115200
lts_prescaler = 1

# Required for software task tracing
dwt_enter_id = 1
dwt_exit_id = 2

# whether to expect malformed ITM packets; useful to debug the stream extraction method
expect_malformed = true

            w.dbg_stop().set_bit()
        });

        // flip device-specific master swtich for tracing
        #[rustfmt::skip]
        ctx.device.DBGMCU.cr.modify(
            |_, w| unsafe {
                w.trace_ioen().set_bit() // master enable for tracing
                 .trace_mode().bits(0b00) // TRACE pin assignment for async mode (SWO), feeds into the ETB
            },
        );

        // setup software tracing
        cortex_m_rtic_trace::configure(
            &mut ctx.core.DCB,
            &mut ctx.core.TPIU,
            &mut ctx.core.DWT,
            &mut ctx.core.ITM,
            1, // task enter DWT comparator ID
            2, // task exit DWT comparator ID
            &TraceConfiguration {
                delta_timestamps: LocalTimestampOptions::Enabled, // prescaler = 1
                absolute_timestamps: GlobalTimestampOptions::Disabled,
                timestamp_clk_src: TimestampClkSrc::AsyncTPIU,
                tpiu_freq: 16_000_000, // Hz
                tpiu_baud: 115_200,    // B/s
                protocol: TraceProtocol::AsyncSWONRZ,
            },
        )
        .unwrap();

        sw_task::spawn().unwrap();

        (Shared {}, Local {}, init::Monotonics())
    }

    #[task(binds = SysTick)]
    fn hardware(_: hardware::Context) {
        software::spawn().unwrap();
    }

    #[task]
    #[trace]
    fn software(_: software::Context) {}
}
```
If the target does not support the requested trace configuration, `cortex_m_rtic_trace::configure` will return an `Err`.
