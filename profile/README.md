# RTIC Scope

RTIC Scope is an auxillary tool for embedded applications using the [RTIC](https://rtic.rs) framework.
By exploiting the ITM/DWT subsystem of the ARM Cortex-M embedded platform [`cargo rtic-scope`](https://github.com/rtic-scope/cargo-rtic-scope) enables the RTIC end-user to record the execution trace of their embedded application.
These records can then be replayed off-line for post-mortem analysis.

This `README.md` will be continuously updated with information on how the aforementioned crates work in isolation and in cooperation.
